      <title>Why AI is an opportunity rather than a danger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2019/0801/1066421-why-ai-is-an-opportunity-rather-than-a-danger/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Originally published on RTÉ Brainstorm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solar system is full of debris and rocks floating around. A meteor shower or a shooting star is debris burning up upon entry to the atmosphere. On occasion, pieces of rock make it all the way through. A much larger rock that could make its way through is an asteroid. About 66 million years ago, the impact from an asteroid brought about the Cretaceous extinction. A repetition of this event is theoretically possible - and the same could be said about all-powerful Artificial Intelligence Overlords marginalising the human race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in the mid 20th century, the field of artificial intelligence has had an interesting ride. Much like the financial markets or Hollywood, there’s been breakthroughs and failures and booms and busts. Driven by advances in deep learning, a great deal of success has been achieved this decade, ushering in the newest AI golden age, along with a frenzy of interest and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current popular views of AI are being shaped primarily by several vocal figures in technology. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said that AI carries the potential to change society deeply and is both exciting and dangerous. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has stated that she believes advances in AI will create different jobs rather than no jobs. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has expressed the view that AI will deliver various improvements to human quality of life, while Tesla founder Elon Musk has called AI &amp;ldquo;a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future dangers AI could pose to humanity is a frequently occurring subject in conversation, be it to break the ice on a first date, to fill the time before a meeting starts or while waiting for a pint at the pub on a Friday evening. And arguably, Musk&amp;rsquo;s statement carries the most bite. It certainly is a very catchy line that makes for a more topical conversation starter than asteroids or the Cretaceous extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, these hypothetical yet sensationalist doomsday opinions are at a point where they dominate the conversation about AI, so much so that the bigger picture on the subject may at the point of being overshadowed and given very little consideration. And that could pose an even greater threat, especially in an age where hype and rhetoric without regard for fact has had a great effect on the fate of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements in AI could lead to a superintelligence that could pose a fundamental risk to human existence - and so could climate change or a 5 km-wide space rock colliding with the Earth. But there are many points of difference between these three risks. AI is a long way away advancing to the point of superintelligence and it’s not a certainty that superintelligence would lead to the end of humanity. Climate change is a very real and present danger, with the time to take action to prevent irreversible consequences continuing to decrease. And then there are the chances of an asteroid striking the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is no good that can come from an asteroid strike or global warming, but AI can literally be one of the best things to happen to humans. This is not said enough - and it can’t be said enough. AI can and is being used to as a tool in many incredible ways. For example, it is being used to help improve prevention of cancer, provide effective treatment, and could one day even be part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is also being leveraged as a promising way to combat climate change. AI-powered simulations and analysis helps make for sustainable urban planning and ocean preservation. It is possible to make more accurate predictions regarding weather events with the help of AI leading to reduced damage to life and property. It can help power grids to be more energy efficient by predicting peak over of usage allowing for better preparation and enhances the benefits of clean energy methods by deploying in ways such as to incorporate weather and other relevant data to make wind turbines more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet arguments on how AI could hypothetically end humanity as we know it at some point in the future, seem to drown out how AI is already helping humanity’s cause. Such contributions pale in comparison to the very real possibility that AI could be the key to finding the answers for some of humanity’s biggest problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a 2018 hearing at the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Stanford Professor Fei-Fei Li said that AI is bound to alter the human experience, and not necessarily for the better. After acknowledging this, Li pointed out that ensuring AI will transform the world for the better is very much in our hands. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing artificial about AI&amp;rdquo;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It’s inspired by people; it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern that AI could pose a threat is very much reasonable. But this possibility is just that - a possibility. Let’s not forget AI is a fundamental opportunity to further the cause of the human civilisation, and that it is in our hands to ensure that it impacts us positively, and be optimistic about what it can mean for us. The world can only be the better place for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The form awakens* (*seems to stir awake from a 4 month slumber) - 2.5/3 : Rounds 1, 2 &amp; 3 of the Ennis Shield (Leinster League Division 3)</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://pgn.chessbase.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://pgn.chessbase.com/cbreplay.js&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
After the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vihanga.ie/post/chess/CoD18&#34;&gt;horrible start to the season&lt;/a&gt; I had at the City of Dublin in September, I was desperate to turn my form and results around. I had signed up to play in as much fixtures as I can for the club&amp;rsquo;s second team who plays in the third division of the Leinster Chess Union leagues, and played in all three opening fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And will you look at that, the results are quite alright.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;resultsLeague.png&#34; /&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, I seem to have played three consecutive games with the black pieces due to playing on three different boards, and the team did alright especially given our standing on joint second after 2 wins and a narrow loss to one of the highest rated teams in the division.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;results3roundsLeague.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;match-1-opening-game-vs-elm-mount-a-very-lucky-escape-very-lucky-indeed&#34;&gt;Match 1 : Opening game vs Elm Mount - A very lucky escape. Very lucky indeed.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a bit of a weird one. I was playing black, on board 5, fairly confident, decent position coming out of the opening, and I was in a mood that day. So, when it looked like there was potential to sacrifice a piece on h3, I was fairly focussed on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this, position, I was so preoccupied whether to take h3 with the bishop on c8 or knight on f4, I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that my opponents last move, Nf1, opens an attack from the bishop on c1 to my knight on f4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd1,Ra1,e1,Bd3,c1,Nf3,f1,Pa2,b2,c3,d4,f2,g2,h3/bKg8,Qd8,Rf8,a8,Bc8,e7,Nf6,f4,Pa7,b7,c6,d5,f7,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;c8h3&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;c1,f4,f1&#34;
            data-title=&#34;it had been a while since I made an early blunder&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of deliberation in my head, I took h3 with the Bishop, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice my blunder till my opponent took the piece on f4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that blunder, I thought my best chance of recovering was to capitalize on whatever little attacking potential I had in this position, and I forged ahead with my plan to put his castle under pressure. My rationale here was that it was easier for me to get both my rooks involved in an assault on his castle than it was for him to make his rook on a1 active, and maybe I might be able to overwhelm his pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as luck would have it, that&amp;rsquo;s just what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd1,Ra1,e1,Bd3,Ne3,Pa2,b2,c3,d4,f2,g2/bKg8,Qg5,Rf8,e8,Nf4,Pa7,b7,c6,d5,f5,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;d1d2&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;g2,g3&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;sustained threats and pressure, and my opponent lets me off&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, due to the perceived threat from f4 that would make open the file for my rook on f8 and further weaken his king, he made the move Qd2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;..Nxg2, he responded with Nf1, again, as what I presume was a hail mary move in the hopes I might overlook a threat on that diagonal, again. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t, he resigned after my next move Nf4+ as the only continuation lead to either losing his queen or checkmate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd2,Ra1,e1,Bd3,Ne3,Pa2,b2,c3,d4,f2/bKg8,Qg5,Rf8,e8,Nf4,Pa7,b7,c6,d5,f5,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;the final position (last move ...Nf4+)&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was glad I got away with the win after that blunder, the team got a 4-2 win in the opening fixture. We went to the pub afterwards, played ping pong while having pints, and watched Man United pull off that awesome 3-2 comeback win against Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was an alright day, but it could have just gone very, very, wrong, for myself, just as well as for United and Jose Mourinho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;match-2-converting-an-advantage-with-surprising-efficiency&#34;&gt;Match 2 : Converting an advantage with surprising efficiency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was a game against Lucan, all the other 5 games had been played the week before; my board had been deferred as an old friend was visiting me the day of the match. The match was balanced on 2.5-2.5 with 5 games played, and I was playing their captain on board 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening was nothing special, left a nice evenly balanced position coming into the midgame.
&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd1,Ra1,f1,Bd3,g5,Nd2,f3,Pa2,b2,c3,d4,e4,f2,g2,h2/bKe8,Qc7,Ra8,h8,Nd7,f6,Bc8,d6,Pa7,b7,c6,d5,e5,f7,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;e8g8&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;e4&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;not the worse position out of the opening&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My move here was to castle, rather than the engine suggested move of capturing the e4 pawn, but the open file was what lead to my advantage, given my opponent sought to make a rash advance with his rook to apply pressure on my castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd3,Re1,e7,Nd2,f3,Pa2,b2,c3,f2,g2,h3/bKg8,Qd6,Ra8,f8,Nd7,Bc8,Pa7,b7,d5,f7,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;d7c5&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;grabbing an advantage&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
But in this position, ...Nc5. Qc3, Ne6. R7xe6,Bxe6. And I was up a rook to a bishop. It had been a recent pattern of mine to play out some fidgety plans leading to drawn positions even when I had the advantage, or even devolve into a loss, but I played through to a winning endgame in what was, on recent form, uncharacteristically surprising efficiency.

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKf3,Rb7,Pa2,b2,c6,h4/bKf6,Re2,g2,Pa7,e5,g6&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;e5e4&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;would&#39;ve made for a nice finish&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would&amp;rsquo;ve been nicer if I had spotted the forced mating sequence here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;e4+. Kf4, Rgf2+. Kg4, Rf3. Rf7+, Kxf7. Kg5, Rg2+. Kh6, Rh3. c7, Rxh4#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had less than a minute on the clock, so I was playing on increments, so it&amp;rsquo;s entirely justifiable that I did things the old fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKd3,Ra7,Pa2,c7,h4/bKf6,Rc2,c6,Pg6&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;g2c2&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;finally saw a game out without a blunder (last move: ...Rg2c2)&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opponent ran out of time here, when I was winning quite comfortably; and the team scored a 3.5-2.5 win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;match-3-a-fast-15-move-draw&#34;&gt;Match 3 : A fast 15 move draw&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Monday evening, I was again playing a couple of days after the match, one of two differred boards. I had just flew back to Dublin the evening before from the MIG&amp;rsquo;18 conference in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had popped into a pub near the playing venue to get a pint, and opened my Macbook to finish up some emails when I see a window with my Twitter home feed showing that Stan Lee had died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the mood to play a game after seeing this, 10 minutes before the start time. I went in, my oppoennet played the Polish opening, that was a first. And I was more than happy to play a line that lead to a draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKg1,Qd1,Rf1,Bc4,Nc3,Pd4,e3,f2,g2,h2/bKe8,Qe5,Rh8,Nf6,Bc8,Pc6,e6,f7,g7,h7&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;d6,c7&#34;              
            data-title=&#34;a quick 15 move draw&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the position, it can be said that I was let off, as my isolated pawn and overall position isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to lead to a whole lot of joy. My move here would&amp;rsquo;ve been Qd6 or Qc7, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been the hardest to defend here. Qd6 might even allow for some attacking momentum if I can get my knight involved. My opponent seemed to agree, and it seemed he had studied the opening and likely positions pretty thoroughly; also the engine concurred with this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as my opponent said, we could&amp;rsquo;ve played for a couple of hours and ended up drawn anyway, or agreed a draw early on that basis and gone home early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost the game 2.5-3.5, but given that league standings are based on game points rather than match points, it&amp;rsquo;s not the end of the world. We are tied second on points in the league standings, we seem quite competitive for a newly promoted team with an average rating that is on the latter end in the league.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can keep this up, come April, the team could be in an interesting position.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;r3ennisStandings.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; height=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, oh hello, a 55 point boost to my FIDE rating. This was a nice surprise, thanks to the K-Factor of 40, as it&amp;rsquo;s less than 30 of my games were FIDE rated.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;fideNovember.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned to play in the Kilkenny Weekender, where I played my first competitive chess since moving to Ireland, for the third consecutive year. But with the fatigue from the travel and the conference and with some heavy weeks ahead of me at work, it seemed the right idea to sit this year out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m likely to play at 2 more games in 2018, with our last Ennis shield fixture again Skerries, and a substitute appearance for the first time this season in the Armstrong Cup for the first team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My form seems to be improving after the blunders in the City of Dublin weekender and the less than ideal play early in the first league match. This is a good sign for my potential performance at the 9 round closed all-play-all in early January, that I entered for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Examining the effects of a virtual character on learning and engagement in serious games</title>
      <link>https://www.vihanga.ie/publication/MIG18/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 16:47:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.vihanga.ie/publication/MIG18/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented my first conference paper at the 11th Motion, Interactions and Games conference held in November 2018. In this paper, we examined the broad effects a virtual character can have on user experience and performance when incorporated as a pedagogical agent in a serious game. We also explored character appearance personalization as a potential way of heightening engagement with the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings can be summaries as follows: - A user is more engaged with a lesson when delivered through a virtual character compared to a non-character control version. - A user retains knowledge better when a lesson is delivered through a virtual character compared to a non-character control version. - There is a propensity for the majority of user attention to be directed at the virtual character, resulting in little attention being paid to the rest of the game environment. - Surprising, character appearance personalization has an effect opposite to what we expected, resulting in participants being significantly less engaged with a personalized character compare to one with a default appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplementary material in the form of the full questionnaire used in the study and free-form user feedback and some interesting points raised by attendees at the conference following my thoughts can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vihanga.ie/post/research/MIG18PaperStudy/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a blog post about my experience at the conference and some photographs can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vihanga.ie/post/blog/MIG18blog/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A calamitous start to the season - 0/2 at the City of Dublin 2018</title>

The 2018 / 2019 ICU season kicked off at the City of Dublin weekender held in September. This season was one I approached with as much intent to perform well, as I had done in a while. This is because I will be taking a step back from playing relatively seriously, at the end of the season, for about a year to focus on the last year of my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my showing at the Irish Championship Supporting events in August not being as convincing as I had hoped after a few good performances earlier in the year, I was at least happy with the fact that I had consolidated the 180 point rating jump I achieved at the Ennis Open in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seeded in the top 10 of the draw in my section. The first round I was playing back against a solid player. After a fairly even middle game phase, I managed to capitalise on my opponent&amp;rsquo;s misstep to go into the end game with a winning position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the stage was set&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;for a trademark pawn ending screw up from me. This has been happening a lot recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my defence, I had studied up on pawn ending theory that I was continually getting wrong, and I had a couple of minutes plus increments on the clock, but this was pretty much inexcusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this position, it was my move, and instead of c5, I played Bxc3 leading the game to a dead draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
            data-size=&#34;500&#34;
            data-pos=&#34;wKe2,Bd2,Pf2,a3,b4,c3/bKc4,Be5,Pe4,c7,b5,a6&#34;
            data-arrows=&#34;c7c5&#34;
            data-squares=&#34;c3&#34;
            data-title=&#34;how to mess up a winning position&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bxc3, Bxc3 Kxc3, Ke3 Kb3, Kxe4 Kxa3, f4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and hold on to your hats people because here comes the height of lunacy. Instead of calculating properly and making c4, Kxb4 ??????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that was it. First game of the season, arguably the worst game I played since February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cbdiagram&#34;
                data-size=&#34;500&#34;
                data-pos=&#34;wKe4,Pf4,b4/bKa3,Pc7,b5,a6&#34;
                data-arrows=&#34;c7c5&#34;
                data-squares=&#34;b4&#34;
                data-title=&#34;how to mess up a drawn position&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I picked up right where I left off, a toothless game and a dumb theoretical blunder towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two games, both against players rated about 200 points beyond me, my rating had already dropped by 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not seem like I could get out of the rut I was in, and a tailspin seemed imminent, so to avoid a dropping an even hundred more rating points, I withdrew at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next competitive game is likely going to be the first match round of the new league season. I will be playing the full league campaign for the Dublin University Ennis Shield team; here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I plug the holes in my endgame and mid-game play isn&amp;rsquo;t so flat.&lt;/p&gt;
