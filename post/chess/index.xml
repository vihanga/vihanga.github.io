      <description>After the horrible start to the season I had at the City of Dublin in September, I was desperate to turn my form and results around. I had signed up to play in as much fixtures as I can for the club&amp;rsquo;s second team who plays in the third division of the Leinster Chess Union leagues, and played in all three opening fixtures.
And will you look at that, the results are quite alright.</description>

      <description>The 2018 / 2019 ICU season kicked off at the City of Dublin weekender held in September. This season was one I approached with as much intent to perform well, as I had done in a while. This is because I will be taking a step back from playing relatively seriously, at the end of the season, for about a year to focus on the last year of my PhD.</description>
