      <description>I presented my first conference paper at the 11th Motion, Interactions and Games conference held in November 2018. In this paper, we examined the broad effects a virtual character can have on user experience and performance when incorporated as a pedagogical agent in a serious game. We also explored character appearance personalization as a potential way of heightening engagement with the character.
Our findings can be summaries as follows: - A user is more engaged with a lesson when delivered through a virtual character compared to a non-character control version.</description>
