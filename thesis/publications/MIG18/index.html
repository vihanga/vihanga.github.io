<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Virtual characters have been employed for many purposes including interacting with players of serious games, with a purpose to increase engagement. These characters are often embodied conversational agents playing diverse roles, such as demonstrators, guides, teachers or interviewers. Recently, much research has been conducted into properties that affect the realism and plausibility of virtual characters, but it is less clear whether the inclusion of interactive agents in serious applications can enhance a user&rsquo;s engagement with the application, or indeed increase efficacy. In a first step towards answering these questions, we conducted a study where a Virtual Learning Environment was used to examine the effect of employing a virtual character to deliver a lesson. In order to investigate whether increased familiarity between the player and the character would help achieve learning outcomes, we allowed participants to customize the physical appearance of the character. We used direct and indirect measures to assess engagement and learning; we measured knowledge retention to ascertain learning via a test at the end of the lesson, and also measured participants&rsquo; perceived engagement with the lesson. Our findings show that a virtual character can be an effective learning aid, causing heightened engagement and retention of knowledge. However, allowing participants to customize character appearance resulted in inhibited engagement, which was contrary to what we expected.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Engagement</strong>: Users showed significantly higher engagement when lessons were delivered through a virtual character compared to non-character controls.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Improved Knowledge Retention</strong>: Virtual character delivery resulted in better knowledge retention compared to traditional presentation methods.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Attention Focus</strong>: User attention was predominantly directed at the virtual character, with limited attention to other environmental elements.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Customization Paradox</strong>: Contrary to expectations, character appearance personalization led to significantly lower engagement compared to default appearances.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="relevance-to-thesis">Relevance to Thesis</h2>

<p>This work laid important groundwork for understanding how virtual characters affect user engagement and learning. While this paper focused on static virtual characters in educational contexts, it motivated the later development of RLAnimate for creating more dynamic, responsive virtual characters that can adapt their behaviors in real-time - addressing some of the limitations identified in this study.</p>
